# Stroboscope
Turn your flashlight into stroboscope

Turn your flashlight into a real stroboscope. Slider helps you control the light frequency. 
Have in mind, that the minimum frequency depends on mobile phone type. E.g. on Huawei p8 lite 2019 it was around 10ms (minimum by code), while on an old Huawei Y from 2014 was around 30.
